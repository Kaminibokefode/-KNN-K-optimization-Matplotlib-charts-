There are two modules that need to be imported in the python notbook: 
- BankData.py
- K_opt_knn.py

In this notebook you will find: 
- see the performance of knn algorithm with the different set of  number of neighbors 
- accuracy of different models for test and trainging data can be seen on line charts to find the optimum value for k 
- Also various default feature of the line chart of matplot lib has been changed. 

Dataset:
Dataset is available with this repository.
